# pay-optical
The codebase for the ATmega8A controlling the payload optical board (separate from PAY-SSM). It acts as a one large Slave device, that's primarly responsbile for collecting optical density and fluorescence measurements on the microfluidics wells. It sends the data back to PAY-SSM through SPI protocol.
