# pay-optical
The codebase for the ATmega328P controlling the payload optical board (separate from PAY-SSM). It acts like a sensor that is responsible for collecting optical density and fluorescence measurements from the microfluidics wells. It sends the data back to PAY-SSM through the SPI protocol.
