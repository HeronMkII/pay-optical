MCP23S17 port expander (PEX)
Datasheet: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20001952C.pdf

A port expander is a device with many GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins.
Each GPIO pin can function as either an input or an output, depending on what
you want to use it for. Using a port expander gives us more GPIO pins to work
with since we have a limited number on the 32M1 itself.

The 32M1 communicates with the PEX over SPI, telling it to use pins as inputs or
outputs, read values from pins, or write values to pins.

The PEX has two "banks", labelled A and B. Each has 8 pins,
labelled GPA0-GPA7 and GPB0-GPB7.

Each PEX device has a 3-bit address, determined by how the pins A2, A1, A0
are connected in hardware. Each SPI command contains the address of the PEX it
is meant for, allowing up to 8 PEX devices to be connected using the same CS
(chip select) line. A PEX will only respond to the command if its address
matches the one sent in the comand.
